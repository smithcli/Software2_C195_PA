# WGU Software II - Advanced Java Concepts

## Performance Assessment task: QAM2: Java Application Development

In this course I developed a Java application to meet the specifications
required in the performance assessment. All course resources are located 
in the [doc/Course_Resources](doc/Course_Resources) directory.

[WGU Performance Assessment](doc/Course_Resources/WGU_Performance_Assessment.pdf) - 
Provides the scenario and requirements for this assessment.

For this assessment it's required that your application is able to run in their virtual machine.
It was cumbersome to work in, so I mirrored versions as closely as possible on my local machine with the following:
- Intellij Community 2021.1.3
- Oracle Java SE 11.0.12
- OpenJFX-SDK-11.0.2
- MySQL-connector-java 8.0.25 
- MySQL-Workbench 8.0.26 community
- MySQL Ver 8.0.26 (MySQL Community Server - GPL)

After quick initial testing to ensure compatibility, I completed the application on my local machine
and moved it over for final testing and submission.

[README.txt](README.txt) - Contains instructions after launch and the versions in the VM.
